Previous papers examined 365 versions of the Linux kernel e counted the number of instances of common (global) coupling between 17 modules a and all other modules in each version, and found that such occurrences grew exponentially with the version number. The authors concluded that, unless Linux was restructured with a bare minimum of common coupling, the software would become difficult to maintain. Using the SQALE method, 6 versions of the Linux kernel were analyzed. All versions received maintainability rating A, showing that the project was a healthy maintainability state.
